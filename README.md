# APPLE QUALITY DATA ANALYSIS

To access the results of the analysis and the model performance evaluations check out [the jupyter notebook](https://github.com/GuillaumeCLEMENT314/DataScience/blob/main/apple_quality_EDA_classification.ipynb)

Here, different basic classification approaches have been evaluated, such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting and support vector machine. The most performant turned out the be the support vector machine with an accuracy of 89.8%. 
Before performing any classification, we performed an exploratory data analysis to familiarize myself with the raw data and data transformation.
